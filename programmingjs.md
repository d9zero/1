    ### Comparison Operators

    Comparison operators usually return single values of true or false:
        - == is equal to
        - != is not equal to
        - === strict equal to
        - !== strict not equal to
        - greater than
        - __<__ less than
        - = greater than or equal to
        - <== less than or equal to

    ### Logical Operators

    Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
        - && "Logical And" This operator tests more than one condition.
        - || "Logical Or" This operator tests at least one condition.
        - ! "Logical Not" This operator takes a single Boolean value and inverts it.
