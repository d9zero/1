  The first step in working in the cloud, is to understand the what resources and platforms are viably communicating. In 102, Git, GitHub, Ubuntu 'terminal', and a text editor are the platforms that are coordinating with each other to provide capatable updates. You can find step-by-step procedures in the link below for 'pulling' data from a cloud service onto your local machine, editing files with the text editor, and 'pushing' updates back into the cloud for future collaboration.

  After a while, the process won't seem as complicated. Just remember to consistently update/save your work!
