While there are many ways to describe a mindset, it can be fundamentally described as an attitude, disposition, mood, inclination, or intention. Mindsets can affect how one perceives, or reviews an encountered experience; thereby adding precedence in an imperative manner, in which why mindsets are important to consider. When encountering a potential challenge or experience, the etymology of the word ‘mindset’ can holistically be viewed from two basic subsets of orientation; Which would include the Fixed Mindset and the Growth Mindset. While rooted to the core terminology, there are noticeable differences between the two distinctive dispositions. 

# *What is a Fixed Mindset?*

A Fixed Mindset and be summarized to encompass a root of observable traits and/or held beliefs. In this psychological orientation, fixed mindset values are aligned with the concepts that a persons’ skills or abilities are set in stone at a predetermined period of development. Which in turn can derive common sets of behavioral traits. 

<ul> When observed under this disposition, a person with a fixed mindset may: 
  
  <li>Only participate in activities that they perceive or personally deem that they are ‘good at’.</li>
  <li>Resign, remove, or cease productivity or efforts when an experience or challenge is perceived to be too difficult.</li>
  <li>Refrain, move around, or avoid perceived challenges.</li>
  <li>Vocalize or demonstrate disdain for difficulties or perceived challenges.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate minimal interests or motivation in activities with minimal background information.</li></ul>

The relational differences from a fixed mindset and a growth mindset are somewhat aligned in a dichotomy-like fashion in disposition, held beliefs, or behaviors. In a stark contrast from a fixed mindset, a growth mindset holds contradictory values.

# *What is a Growth Mindset?*

<ul>A Growth Mindset in comparison with the former, is fostered on the belief that a persons’ capacities and talents can be improved over time with commitment to do so. In-kind with the behavioral affects of the contrasting disposition, a growth mindset also can derive observable traits linked with its underlying psychology:

  <li>A person can become ‘good’ at a selected activity or experience if they make a choice to do so.
  <li>Practice makes perfect.
  <li>May be willing to undergo or understand new challenges.
  <li>Vocalize or demonstrate a desire for learning.
  <li>Open to constructive criticism.</li></ul>

While there are noticeable differences between the two mindsets, fortunately the latter disposition fosters a ‘sense’ of open opportunities and desirable outcomes; which is fundamental to innovation and entrepreneurism. Although demonstrators of both mindsets aren’t always polarized in a singular manner, the reinforcement of a mindset can sometimes become fleeting. In support of a growth mindset, I personally like to subscribe to a few reminders that sustain a positive and open momentum.
