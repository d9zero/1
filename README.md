# *What is a Mindset?*
While there are many ways to describe a mindset, it can be fundamentally described as an attitude, disposition, mood, inclination, or intention. Mindsets can affect how one perceives, or reviews an encountered experience; thereby adding precedence in an imperative manner, in which why mindsets are important to consider. When encountering a potential challenge or experience, the etymology of the word ‘mindset’ can holistically be viewed from two basic subsets of orientation; Which would include the Fixed Mindset and the Growth Mindset. While rooted to the core terminology, there are noticeable differences between the two distinctive dispositions. 

# *What is a Fixed Mindset?*

A Fixed Mindset and be summarized to encompass a root of observable traits and/or held beliefs. In this psychological orientation, fixed mindset values are aligned with the concepts that a persons’ skills or abilities are set in stone at a predetermined period of development. Which in turn can derive common sets of behavioral traits. 

When observed under this disposition, a person with a fixed mindset may: 
Only participate in activities that they perceive or personally deem that they are ‘good at’.
Resign, remove, or cease productivity or efforts when an experience or challenge is perceived to be too difficult.
Refrain, move around, or avoid perceived challenges.
Vocalize or demonstrate disdain for difficulties or perceived challenges.
Demonstrate minimal interests or motivation in activities with minimal background information.

The relational differences from a fixed mindset and a growth mindset are somewhat aligned in a dichotomy-like fashion in disposition, held beliefs, or behaviors. In a stark contrast from a fixed mindset, a growth mindset holds contradictory values.

# *What is a Growth Mindset?*

A Growth Mindset in comparison with the former, is fostered on the belief that a persons’ capacities and talents can be improved over time with commitment to do so. In-kind with the behavioral affects of the contrasting disposition, a growth mindset also can derive observable traits linked with its underlying psychology:

A person can become ‘good’ at a selected activity or experience if they make a choice to do so.
Practice makes perfect.
May be willing to undergo or understand new challenges.
Vocalize or demonstrate a desire for learning.
Open to constructive criticism.

# *Reminders*

While there are noticeable differences between the two mindsets, fortunately the latter disposition fosters a ‘sense’ of open opportunities and desirable outcomes; which is fundamental to innovation and entrepreneurism. Although demonstrators of both mindsets aren’t always polarized in a singular manner, the reinforcement of a mindset can sometimes become fleeting. In support of a growth mindset, I personally like to subscribe to a few reminders that sustain a positive and open momentum.
